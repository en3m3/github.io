My name is Erik, I'm majoring in Applied technology. I grew up in California, served my mission in Uruguay, and moved to Utah a couple years ago.  I work from 7:00 am - 2:00 pm every weekday and I can usually find time anywhere after that. I currently work at a company that designs, hosts, and maintains mainly dental websites.

I first started learning web programming around 1998 when everybody was still adjusting to CSS2.  I took around 140 credits at a junior college after I graduated from high school as a computer science major.  I taught myself Javascript (I had already at this point taken quite a few other programming classes) and worked for my friend who was a webmaster for a company for about a year.  After 14 years working at a pharmacy and moving to Utah I started working at my current company working on some of the more complicated requests that our clients have. I have been programming for about 20 years and really enjoy programming related to graphics and animation.

 Since a lot of my experience has been self taught, I hope to mainly develop my knowledge of best practices and industry standards that I'm sure I missed along the way.  I'm especially excited to learn more about interfacing with APIs and handling JSON data. I've had to claw my way through a few projects at work already that would have been much smoother if I was more comfortable with those skills.
